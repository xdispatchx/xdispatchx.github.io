			<h1>Telmo Brito's Exhaust Mod</h1>
			<p class="subHeading">
				 These are Pictures and descriptions of how I did Telmo Brito's Exhaust mod on an American VStar 650
			</p>
			<p class="articleText">
				I had previously done the 3 hole mod on my stock exhaust pipes.
				<img class="articlePic" alt="Exhaust with 3 Hole Mod" src="images/telmo1.jpg">
				Then I removed the cone by using a dremel. I cut through the weld at the top and removed the cone with plyers. You can also use a 1 1/4 hole saw bit. Pic #1 (edit: The cone on the later model V-Stars are welded all the way around.)
				<img class="articlePic" alt="Welds cut from Stock Exhaust" src="images/telmo2.jpg">
				With the cone removed, I drilled 4 pilot holes between my already existing holes. Pic #2
				<img class="articlePic" alt="4 Additional Holes Added to Stock" src="images/telmo3.jpg">
				I then enlarged the pilot holes using a 3/8 bit. Pic #3
				<img class="articlePic" alt="Additional Holes Enlarged" src="images/telmo4.jpg">
				Using a round file and Dremel grinder I started to file the excess metal to open the space completely #4
				<img class="articlePic" alt="Excess Metal Removed" src="images/telmo5.jpg">
				The rest was grinding and finishing with my Dremel and file to smooth the edges. Pic #5
				<img class="articlePic" alt="Smoothed Edges" src="images/telmo6.jpg">
				The last step was to paint with high temp enamel, like you might use on a grill. Telmo Brito used silver, I happened to have black. It needs another coat, but you get the idea. Pic #6
				<img class="articlePic" alt="High Temp Enamel Applied" src="images/telmo7.jpg">
				Here is the finished top pipe. This was taken before I finished the bottom pipe, so the bottom is unfinished in this pic. Pic #7
				<img class="articlePic" alt="Finished Top Pipe" src="images/telmo8.jpg">
				The resulting sound from this mod is a much deeper not so tinny sound as compared to the 3 hole mod.  It definitely has a nice "Bark" when you hit it, yet it's not over-powering or too loud.  I absolutely give this mod a thumbs up.  Great job by Telmo Brito in coming up with this.</p>
