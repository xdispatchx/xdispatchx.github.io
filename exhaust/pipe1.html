			<h1>Telmo Brito's Exhaust Mod</h1>

				 These are Pictures and descriptions of how I did Telmo Brito's Exhaust mod on an American VStar 650
			</p>
			<p class="articleText">I drilled three 3/8" holes through the slanted outside part and on through the inside baffle about an inch further in.<br><br>
			This definitely makes a difference.  The sound is louder and just a little deeper. It has a staccato sound composed of some higher frequency pops. Sound is hard to describe. It's not really the sound I was wanting, but it'll do until I can afford the pipes</p>
